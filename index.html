                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>Mariah is a certified Yoga Alliance instructor, completing her 200 hour yoga teacher training with Kindness Yoga in Denver, CO, where she currently resides. Originally from Boston, MA, Mariah found her love for yoga over 10 years ago at a boutique studio in the North End (Boston’s little Italy). Her passion for yoga stems from both its physical and mental benefits. She believes the benefits of yoga lie in getting back to the basics - incorporating guided meditation and more simple poses (asanas) to create an experience that brings awareness to the present moment and encourages growth, although she does enjoy playing around with some of the more “fancy” poses too.</p>

                    <p>Mariah believes yoga is for everyone, whether you're flexible or not. Everyone's bodies are built differently and everyone's skill level is different, but that shouldn’t hinder anyone from reaping the benefits of yoga. Her goal as an instructor is to design a class that's unique to your individual needs, whether that's to relax and restore, stretch and lengthen, build strength, or to simply let loose and explore challenging poses. She specializes in working with small groups and will customize each class.</p>
